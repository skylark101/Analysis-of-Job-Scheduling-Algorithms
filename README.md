Job Scheduling Project  - Consisting of Working Code | Power point Presentation | Review Paper
Here I present our project based on various algorithms required for Job Scheduling.

Algorithms used  : 
1. First Come First Serve Algorithm 
2. Round Robin Algorithm
3. Priority Based Scheduling
4. Shortest Job First Algorithm

There is a vivid analysis on all these algorithms and we have tried to find the best and most optimised algorithm for every different data set.
